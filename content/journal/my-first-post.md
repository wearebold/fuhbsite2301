## BROWSCULPT10

### BROW SCULPT PROCESS
This treatment will start with a consultation to discuss your brow goals and how we can work to achieve them.

Next we will start the process by relaxing the hair: breaking down the hair structure to make it straighter and easier to manipulate.

After that we will brush them into your desired position and then apply a treatment lotion to set them in place.

This is then followed by a traditional HD Brow Treatment to tint and shape the brows.

This style of brow is proving to be very popular at the moment and we cannot wait to see your transformation!

Who wouldnâ€™t want fuller, fluffier brows?
