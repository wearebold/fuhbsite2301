## Overview 
Our nail polish specialists use professional products, such as Jessica GELeration, The Gel Bottle and Glitterbells to deliver maximum protection against chipping and peeling. Our unique process can help you get long-lasting gel manicures that look just like you went to the salon. Choose from a variety of colours, designs, and add-ons, including glitter or French tips to get the manicure you have always wanted!

## Summary Manicure
Our manicure is a process of improving the appearance of your natural nails. Keeping the length short and filing and buffing them, can help to achieve different, beautiful nail types. Whether you like your nails square or pointed, thereâ€™s a wide variety of colours and techniques that will help you achieve a manicure that suits your style.

## Summary Pedicure
Our Pedicure treatment will leave your feet looking and feeling spectacular. During our pedicure, we will use pumice stones to remove dead skin cells followed by a warm sea salt scrub to exfoliate. This is then followed by a foot soak using a selection of our finest oils and butters, an express massage to those hard worked muscles in the legs and thighs, finishing with your choice of nails being shaped, cut and finished with a polish of your choice. Your feet will then be wrapped nicely warm and dry to help you relax before leaving for home.
